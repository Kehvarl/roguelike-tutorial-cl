# Part 1 - Drawing the @ symbol and moving it around

## Loading our project
We will start with getting the project connected to SLIMA so we have some assistnace from our IDE.
* Open your project folder in Atom.
  * If SLIMA doesn't automatically start, select "Packages" -> "SLIMA" -> "Lisp Process" -> "Start"
  * Once an Atom-Friendly lisp instance is running, it should automatically connect.  If not select "Packages" -> "SLIMA" -> "Lisp Process" -> "Connect".
* At the bottom of your Atom screen you should either have an open REPL, or a pull-out holding that Repl.
* Place your cursor in the REPL after the `CL-USER>` prompt and type the following commands to load your project.
  * `(ql:quickload :rogulike-tutorial-cl)`
  * `(in-package :roguelike-tutorial-cl)`
* If there were any errors, please make sure that you've followed all the steps in part-0, including the symlink into your quicklisp directory.  Also double-check that you've spelled the name of your project correctly.
